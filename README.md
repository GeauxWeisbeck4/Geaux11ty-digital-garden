# 11ty Digital Garden (Geaux Digital Garden)

I am making my digital garden with 11ty. After much internal debate, I decided that one of my most important sites should be handled by my favorite static site generator, that has an awesome community, and is such a perfect tool for planting (or building) this garden so I can start to cultivate my ideas in a public place.

## I've heard you talk about digital gardens for like a while now - why make this now?

So I had a digital garden that got all messed up because it was on Gatsby and I kind of said f*** it and kept my digital garden to myself. That made it just my personal knowledge system and not a digital garden.  I've been meaning to do this for quite some time, I just have been busy with a lot of other time consuming things. 

But its time - its been calling my name for far too long. Plus it's a perfect way to start off my 100 projects in 100 days. It'll be cool. 

Plus I must mention, I haven't stopped writing notes or posts and stuff, so there is going to be a lot to sift through here. Have fun!

## To Use This Template

This will hopefully be an 11ty Starter Project (I would be so honored), so you can locate it [on the 11ty Starter Projects Page](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/). You will also be able to use as a template on the GitHub Repo or fork it and clone it to your local dev environment. Either way, to get started just do this:

```angular2html
// If you haven't cloned it from GitHub yet...
$ git clone https://github.com/GeauxWeisbeck4/11ty-digital-garden
$ cd 11ty-digital-garden
$ npm install

// Fire it up on the server while your at it!
$ npm run start
```
