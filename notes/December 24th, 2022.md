    - It's getting close to Christmas and I still need to go Xmas shopping for Lisa. I have a couple things I'm going to get her this year :) - I hope she'll like it. I already gave her a pretty great gift yesterday from what I could tell, if you know what I mean.
    - Ok gotta get back to work, lots going on - I'll chat in a bit. 
    - ^^09:13^^ - Getting started again before I go shopping for Christmas. I've got a few things to work - a shit ton of a few things as a matter of fact. We'll see how this list looks at the end of the day!
        - Just had a really good morning with Lisa - now she's doing something in the bathroom and I'm about to figure out this rent situation. I'm gonna get a couple bug bounties I think. That is something to work on too, damn, too much cool shit on the internet. Time to get back to work - after I check out Ideanote.

    - Forestry.io Just announced their end of life date: March 22, 2023

__The full announcement is on their [Slack](https://forestry-community.slack.com/archives/C2R43R7SB/p1671733908873459) (open to join). Here's the skinny:

* End of life is March 22nd, 2023
* Everything is switching to [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/)
* They provided docs for [migration](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/overview/) and how it will [impact various frameworks](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/missing-forestry-features/) 

I haven't used Tina yet, but hopefully it's as easy to configure and user-friendly as [Forestry.io](https://Forestry.io)

    - UseEffect: why is fetching data considered a side-effect but not accessing window.location?

__I always thought of a side-effect as a read or write operation that is performed while rendering a functional component, and that accesses resources outside of those provided as props. Sort of like the definition of a pure function.

So when I needed to read window.location, I figured it had to be in a useEffect. Turns out the linter doesn't require that window.location be a dependency, so I guess it's ok to access window directly. This means my mental model of a React side-effect is wrong... But why?

If merely fetching data (which is a read operation) is considered a side-effect, then why isn't window.location?

So now I'm wondering, are functional components actually not really pure? Are they only "write pure" but not "read pure"?

    - State held inside a component gets reset whenever it is unmounted. My doubt is that if redux is used and state is kept elsewhere. What happens then? will the state get reset if the component where you use it gets unmounted ?

    - Some Friday afternoon Josh Fleeks Hype

__I feel like this transfer kinda slipped through the cracks and maybe I’m wrong. But this dude has some serious potential in the slot or on PR. Not the absolute fastest guy but he’s got wheels and is slippery. He’s also a grown ass man using his 6th year of eligibility.

    - Cart Total issues.

__Trying to think of some math that will give me my cart total in React. I have a cart array and that array has a total. So [Cart.total](https://Cart.total) is = 0, but in the cart array are products. Each product has  a price. So maybe [Cart.total](https://Cart.total) =  each product.price? Ik this is bad I am just trying to explain my issue lol.
