    - Well the interview has come and gone - I'm likely going to go without a job once again. Sitting here thinking about it, I'm kind of pissed off at all this bullshit trying to get a job. It's so stressful trying to get ready for each one of these interviews that comes every couple weeks and then I completely choke live. 
        - Point - I had studied Angular for a week after also developing with Angular for a couple years now - not constantly but quite a bit, plus I had been using React mainly lately. I was literally cruising through building a MEAN Stack app while practicing, but then the interview comes and KABLAM! I fucking choke it up. It's debilitating and I'm sick of myself at this point - as well as all the interviews. I've been doing this too long to give up now, but at what point do you say "Ok maybe I need a bootcamp, even though I use JavaScript daily and build lots of shit". I dunno, life's so goddamn hard.
        - Another point - we're behind on rent because all these interviewers want me to lay out how to build an app while talking to them and without any resources. I get it that you want the candidate to know everything, but I'm not great at memorizing and I have to constantly keep up notes, but I'm slowly getting better - not working on a team is making me a worse developer and more cut off of from society. PLUS I'M ABOUT TO BE FUCKING HOMELESS!! JUST GIVE ME A JOB, I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT. I PROMISE I CAN DO THE JOB AND THEN SOME.
            - Every interviewer has their own style and asks things differently - I'm supposed to be prepared for all of that? Well I tried this time as much as I could and it didn't matter like usual. Quit judging me based off of one interaction please.

- # Observations
    - Interviewers always say they'll help you get to the answer, but they don't - they love to sit and watch you struggle.
        - I always need that tiny little push - today I just needed to get past the API part, because I knew what he was talking about, the words just didn't hit my tongue. Fucking fuck.
