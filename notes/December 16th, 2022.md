    - Court today - yuck. Let's see if I can get them to have any empathy for our situation and shitty fucking year. Excuse my language, but Jesus-Fuckin-Christ this year has been FUCKING FUCKED THE FUCK UP! SORRY - sorry for my language.
        - I didn't mean to use an injunction.

        - So today just sucked. Apparently you have no rights as a tenant anymore. It didn't even matter that they didn't take my rent payment, the judge just said I better figure my shit out in 10 days - that's totally fucked. We'll see what I can pull together I guess.
        - Time for Tar Heel Dev Studio.
