    - Well it's the last day of 2022 and I'm going to be honest, I thought this day would never fucking come. Look at how shitty this year has been'
        - Unemployed all year
        - Getting evicted from two apartments
        - Lisa cheated on me
        - Spent half the year chasing and sick
        - Broke iMac
        - Haven't talked to my mom
        - A lot more than just that
    - This year was just fucking awful. I hope I don't stay stuck next year. Please ol great force of the world, help my life get better - I'm begging you.
