    - I'm not sure where we're going to live. We really need a miracle y'all - anything would be nice. 
    - I'm going to probably focus on my digital garden and developer blog this morning with the Egghead tutorials. I'm really excited to get playing around with some stuff. I'm almost about to have my very first design system ready too!

    - Forestry.io Just announced their end of life date: March 22, 2023

__The full announcement is on their [Slack](https://forestry-community.slack.com/archives/C2R43R7SB/p1671733908873459) (open to join). Here's the skinny:

* End of life is March 22nd, 2023
* Everything is switching to [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/)
* They provided docs for [migration](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/overview/) and how it will [impact various frameworks](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/missing-forestry-features/) 

I haven't used Tina yet, but hopefully it's as easy to configure and user-friendly as [Forestry.io](https://Forestry.io)

    - Simple Explanation Of 8 Important React Concepts

    - Should I look for a new job?

__During my six months at my current company (first job), I have been working on a solo project utilizing Next.js and TypeScript. While I have learned a great deal through this experience, the lack of code reviews and collaborative work, as well as inadequate pay, has led me to consider seeking employment elsewhere.

The previous developer on this project also seemed to have a limited understanding of React, as evidenced by:

- Their use of an imperative hook called `useRender` to force a re-render on the components, rather than using the setters, which clearly goes against the principles of React.
- Abusing `useEffect` to transform data for rendering or to control form state.
- Reliance on conditional hook declarations.
- Code formatting or code analysis tools (such as ESLint, Prettier, commit hooks, etc.) were not employed, leading to inconsistency in the codebase.
- There were no type generators or introspection tools.
- There was improper use of TypeScript (`any` everywhere, poor type definitions, and a lack of run-time validators, etc.).

Among other issues.

As part of my job duties, I was responsible for refactoring the existing codebase, implementing basic CI/CD processes, streamlining the deployment process, developing new features, and completing other tasks.

I am currently working for an outsourcing company in South America, serving an American client. My current salary is within the range of $500 USD per month ($6K annually), which is not great. While freelancing is an option, it is not necessarily an easy path to pursue. Plus, I am more interested in continuing to learn and grow as a developer through the mentorship and guidance of more experienced developers.

However, given my limited professional experience, I began to question whether it would be advisable to seek new employment at this time, as a resume with only six months of experience may not be particularly impressive to potential employers.

Should I aim for the year? What should I do?

    - Transfer Portal Wish List?

__The sub has been understandably slower the past few days with portal transfers and commitments news, due to the holidays. Starting today, there is exactly 3 weeks left of this first portal window before it closes, until opening back up on May 1st. Who are some players in the portal, realistic chance or not, that you'd like to see end up in scarlet and cream?

I'm still very optimistic about Malik Hornsby, as the rumor mill is still pointing him in our direction. [He set January 8th as the date for his announcement](https://huskercorner.com/2022/12/26/nebraska-football-malik-hornsby-contender/). Baylor fans believe there is hope he might land there, too: https://www.si.com/college/baylor/football/baylor-bears-transfer-portal-target-malik-hornsby-arkansas-razorbacks-potential

As a random (perhaps not *too* random) portal athlete, I'd be stoked to see land here is former Syracuse safety [Ja'Had Carter](https://247sports.com/Player/Ja-Had-Carter-46042794/). Maybe Tony White could work his magic in persuading him into Lincoln. Doesn't appear like we're highly lacking in options for the secondary, but switching over to a 3-3-5 would allow him more opportunity for versatility within that scheme.

Any other players you guys think we could use that could be convinced N?
