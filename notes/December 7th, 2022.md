- # Noon breaker break
    - So I stopped for a sex break around 7:30 with Lisa, which was killer fun. We did our thing and then I walked her to work. So I walked the entire couple miles which was fine you know. But then when I left, it started raining. No, actually IT FUCKING POURED THE ENTIRE WAY HOME AND I WAS SOAKING WET WHAT THE FUCK 
    - Ok finally am about to work. God damn wetness shit fuck. I hate the rain.

        - Here goes nothing - I'm not sure what I'm going to build or how I'm going to. I'll kind of just figure it out I guess.
        - It's not as bad as I think.
