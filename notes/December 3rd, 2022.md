- # Saturday - CFB Championship Weekend
    - I am going to find some games to gamble on and hopefully I can find some money from somewhere to lay down on the games. I can totally win some big bucks today. Like last year - lol last year I totally blew my money on the games and messed them up bad on conference championship weekend. Baylor killed me and then like some Middle USA team fucked me out of nowhere.
    - I need to start writing more about college football. I need to start putting out more content period, but especially about things I love. I am going to start that habit with this Roam app and my digital garden
    - So for my other blogs today, I need to write on my Deno blog, Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, and especially need to do my newsletter. I think the Deno blog will be good to talk about making this website, Medium I can talk about Digital Gardens, Dev.to will continue my React thing, and Hashnode I'll start a series or something.
