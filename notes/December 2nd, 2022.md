        - Wow I totally wasted a bunch of time on this again haha. There's 36 minutes left and I'm kinda just getting back to working on this. To be fair, I'm really dope sick. I also can't get VS Code to cooperate so I'm going to restart the computer before this finishes. Hey this is a stateful component! HAHAHA
        - Fuck I'm funny. Ok I'll be back.

        - Ok it's on break... weird.

        - This one has to be it - I should also be able to get a couple other sites done - maybe. I'm very easily distracted it turns out. ADHD dammit.

    - While I did get a lot of good things done today, overall it was quite a shitty day. I was sick for most of the day because I went 30 hours without using and it sucked. But I did make considerable progress in my job applications and in procrastinating everything else. Haha just joking.
