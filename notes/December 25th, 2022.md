    - Merry Christmas! What an awesome day with Lisa - but now it's time to get some stuff done from yesterday.
    - I ended up spending the whole afternoon and evening with Lisa after we got back from Target and Harris Teeter. We talked all night about our lives and about how much we love each other. We celebrate the holidays in the best possible way.
    - We've got a lot to do so I got to get going on stuff. Merry Christmas!
