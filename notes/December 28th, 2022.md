    - Forestry.io Just announced their end of life date: March 22, 2023

__The full announcement is on their [Slack](https://forestry-community.slack.com/archives/C2R43R7SB/p1671733908873459) (open to join). Here's the skinny:

* End of life is March 22nd, 2023
* Everything is switching to [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/)
* They provided docs for [migration](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/overview/) and how it will [impact various frameworks](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/missing-forestry-features/) 

I haven't used Tina yet, but hopefully it's as easy to configure and user-friendly as [Forestry.io](https://Forestry.io)

    - East's Carroll-Jackson takes road less traveled to Big Ten scholarship

__I'm consistently impressed by what the players have to say about this staff. A player's development and experience is the most important thing - yes more then wins - and comments like this are just incredible. Happy as hell for this kid.

    - 2023 tickets?

__Hi all.  Looking to see if anyone has an idea of when tickets might go on sale to the public for next football season?  Hoping to go with my step-dad as he is a long time fan/alumni who's got me rooting for the Huskers.  We'd be coming from Cali so hopefully I can get the jump on tickets.

Thanks all!

    - Harvey the Snake

__I was listening to today’s Husker Online podcast and they were discussing Ronnie Green’s retirement. 

The conversation led to Harvey Pearlman and how he wanted to be overly-involved in football matters, pushing out Osborne, Harvey &amp; Eichorst not allowing Bo to hire a recruiting department, holding back on private jet usage for recruiting and more. 

It’s often understated how vital complete buy-in from the University is when it comes to football success. Also, how difficult admins can make a coaches life if they decide they want him gone. 

Just another reminder that through the last 20 years of Husker Football struggles, it all circles back to a Chancellor who wanted attention.

    - Multi environment CI/CD pipeline for react js app using Jenkins

__I am assigned to make a CI/CD pipeline for react application using Jenkins at my workplace. I have never worked on devops before and I'm the only front-end developer at my company, I'm really not sure how to go about. I mean I have create a very basic pipeline using docker and Jenkins. So if I push code to master branch on git repo, it triggers the job in Jenkins which clones that repo and creates a docker image and run it on server and it works. But we want more sophisticated pipeline with multiple environments like dev, staging and production. I'm not sure how to approach that, do I just copy the same pipeline with three different repos? I read like unit test should be done in dev environment and also we need to add penetration testing and system integration testing (how that's even done in Jenkins for react), I have given udemy course on penetration testing since I have never done it, but thats different issue. I'm really confused about how to make this pipeline and what's the workflow for each pipeline. Also I have added unit tests within Jenkins as a stage before building docker image but do I add that in GitHub actions if there are going to be more developer working on same project or keep at both Jenkins and GitHub? Also are these all environment should work independently or they should be dependent on each other? Does triggering dev environment should in turn trigger the staging environment if it is successfully passes dev environment build process. Where should I start?
