    - Flexbox
        - when we have a `display: flex` and we need to move objects, justify content goes horizontal while align-items goes vertical
            - ```css
nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

a a a                                     ->                              a a a

nav {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
}

a a a

 ||
 \/

a a a```
        - `flex-direction: row row-reverse column column-reverse;`

    - Well I got a lot to get done today - it's not like things aren't stressful enough anyways, but now we have even more rent due than we thought. I thought we finally fucking had it paid off which sucks donkey dick. It's like hey, I'm glad y'all care so much about us! You are gonna evict us and we came up with your fucking rent money assholes! God dammit, well let's go get it today bud.
    - It's night time now and I'm about to settle in to do my MEAN Stack Dev  Newsletter tutorials. I can't tell if Lisa would be mad if I laid down by her or not - it seems like she'd be pissed. I dunno, I'm just gonna code till my little brain can't take it no more. Also,  RIP Mike Leech - the GOAT. I'm so sad, I can't put into words how much worse off everyone is now because you're gone.

    - Wasm cause significant loss of performance

__Hello,

I'm running some js/ wasm , that I complied from a C program with emscripten. Everything works "fine" as in, it seems to be able to load the file and run it, however, whenever it runs, the whole website freezes, even Firefox tells me the page is dead. I cannot for the life of me figure out why, or how even to debug it.

There is no memory leaks or infinite loops as the C binary works fine. I'm just not too sure what I'm doing wrong , as I have another wasm file like this , that I'm also running on this website (not at the same time) and it works just fine....

Any help is appreciated, I can also share the repo if needed !

    - How to build your own Figma like view, with drag and drop

__Hi!  


I'm in the search to build an interface like Mailchimp. Where you can drag and drop blocks into a certain order and once you click them can modify their properties.   


F.e. You can drag in a Text block from the right side of the screen to the middle, your main page editor. Then if you click the block the right side turns into a properties panel, where you can f.e. modify paddings or margins. 

&amp;x200B;

Now I've been searching a lot on this and can't find decent solutions that don't use HTML. I need a editor that allows views to be build based of JSON, because we're want it to be parsed on different/non-web platforms. 

&amp;x200B;

Does anyone have some recommendations? [https://craft.js.org/](https://craft.js.org/) something like this, but not with HTML.

&amp;x200B;

Other options is for us to do it all ourselves.
