    - How to respond to events immediately in React

__Using state changes are asynchronous. So what would I do if I wanted to immediately make a change (non-UI) based on state.

For example when user clicks on something I want an immediate change in another component instead of having to wait for the second click for the change to take effect

    - Still stuck.

__Hi. I tried asking a question yestertday (where i am still stuck) but people couldnt understand it. I will try rephraising it. In the below code , if i want to upload multiple images, do i have to manually write import from src multiple times at the top in Card.js? Or is there a dynamic way to upload multiple images like how we do with other props? Please go through the code once of Card.js and App.js.

(I am a beginner).
