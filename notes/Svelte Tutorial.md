- # Part 1 - Introduction
    - ## Your first component
        - ## Adding data
            - A component that just renders some static markup isn't very interesting. Let's add some data.
            - First, add a script tag to your component and declare aÂ nameÂ variable:
            - ```javascript
<script>
	let name = 'Svelte';
</script>

<h1>Hello world!</h1>```
            - Then, we can refer toÂ nameÂ in the markup:
            - ```javascript
<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>```
            - Inside the curly braces, we can put any JavaScript we want. Try changingÂ nameÂ toÂ name.toUpperCase()Â for a shoutier greeting.
            - ```javascript
<h1>Hello {name.toUpperCase()}!</h1>```
        - ### Dynamic Attributes
            - ## Shorthand attributes
                - It's not uncommon to have an attribute where the name and value are the same, likeÂ src={src}. Svelte gives us a convenient shorthand for these cases:
                - ```javascript
- <img {src} alt="A man dances." />
```
        - ## Styling
            - Just like in HTML, you can add aÂ <style>Â tag to your component. Let's add some styles to theÂ <p>Â element:
            - ```javascript
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<style>	p {
		color: purple;
		font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;
		font-size: 2em;
	}</style>```
            - Importantly, these rules areÂ __scoped to the component__. You won't accidentally change the style ofÂ <p>Â elements elsewhere in your app, as we'll see in the next step
        - ## Nested Components
            - It would be impractical to put your entire app in a single component. Instead, we can import components from other files and include them in our markup.
            - Add aÂ <script>Â tag that importsÂ Nested.svelte...
            - ```javascript
- <script>
	import Nested from './Nested.svelte';
</script>
```
            - ...and include aÂ <Nested />Â component:
            - ```javascript
- <p>This is a paragraph.</p><Nested />
```
            - Notice that even thoughÂ Nested.svelteÂ has aÂ <p>Â element, the styles fromÂ App.svelteÂ don't leak in.
            - Component names are always capitalised, to distinguish them from HTML elements.
        - ## HTML Tags
            - Ordinarily, strings are inserted as plain text, meaning that characters likeÂ <Â andÂ >Â have no special meaning.
            - But sometimes you need to render HTML directly into a component. For example, the words you're reading right now exist in a markdown file that gets included on this page as a blob of HTML.
            - In Svelte, you do this with the specialÂ {@html ...}Â tag:
            - ```javascript
<p>{@html string}</p>```
            - Svelte doesn't perform any sanitization of the expression insideÂ {@html ...}Â before it gets inserted into the DOM. In other words, if you use this feature it's critical that you manually escape HTML that comes from sources you don't trust, otherwise you risk exposing your users to XSS attacks.
        - ## Assignments
            - At the heart of Svelte is a powerful system ofÂ __reactivity__Â for keeping the DOM in sync with your application state â€” for example, in response to an event.
            - To demonstrate it, we first need to wire up an event handler (we'll learn more about theseÂ [later](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/dom-events)):
            - ```javascript
- <button on:click={increment}>
```
            - Inside theÂ incrementÂ function, all we need to do is change the value ofÂ count:
            - ```javascript
function increment() {
	count += 1;}```
            - Svelte 'instruments' this assignment with some code that tells it the DOM will need to be updated.
        - ## Declarations
            - Svelte automatically updates the DOM when your component's state changes. Often, some parts of a component's state need to be computed fromÂ __other__Â parts (such as aÂ fullnameÂ derived from aÂ firstnameÂ and aÂ lastname), and recomputed whenever they change.
            - For these, we haveÂ __reactive declarations__. They look like this:
            - ```javascript
let count = 0;$: doubled = count * 2;```
            - Don't worry if this looks a little alien. It'sÂ [valid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label)Â (if unconventional) JavaScript, which Svelte interprets to mean 're-run this code whenever any of the referenced values change'. Once you get used to it, there's no going back.
            - Let's useÂ doubledÂ in our markup:```javascript 
            - ```javascript
<button>...</button>

<p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p>```
            - Of course, you could just writeÂ {count * 2}Â in the markup instead â€” you don't have to use reactive values. Reactive values become particularly valuable (no pun intended) when you need to reference them multiple times, or you have values that depend onÂ __other__Â reactive values.
        - ## Statements
            - We're not limited to declaring reactiveÂ __values__Â â€” we can also run arbitraryÂ __statements__Â reactively. For example, we can log the value ofÂ countÂ whenever it changes:
            - ```javascript
let count = 0;

$: console.log(`the count is ${count}`);```
            - You can easily group statements together with a block:
            - ```javascript
$: {
	console.log(`the count is ${count}`);
	alert(`I SAID THE COUNT IS ${count}`);}```
            - You can even put theÂ $:Â in front of things likeÂ ifÂ blocks:
            - ```javascript
$: if (count >= 10) {
	alert('count is dangerously high!');
	count = 0;}```
        - ## Updating Arrays and Objects
            - 
                - [ğŸ”—](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/declaring-props)
                - Because Svelte's reactivity is triggered by assignments, using array methods likeÂ pushÂ andÂ spliceÂ won't automatically cause updates. For example, clicking the 'Add a number' button doesn't currently do anything.
                - One way to fix that is to add an assignment that would otherwise be redundant:
                - ```javascript
function addNumber() {
	numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
	numbers = numbers;}```
                - But there's a more idiomatic solution:
                - ```javascript
function addNumber() {
	numbers = [...numbers, numbers.length + 1];}```
                - You can use similar patterns to replaceÂ pop,Â shift,Â unshiftÂ andÂ splice.
                - Assignments toÂ __properties__Â of arrays and objects â€” e.g.Â obj.foo += 1Â orÂ array[i] = xÂ â€” work the same way as assignments to the values themselves.
                - ```javascript
function addNumber() {
	numbers[numbers.length] = numbers.length + 1;}```
                - A simple rule of thumb: the name of the updated variable must appear on the left hand side of the assignment. For example this...
                - ```javascript
- const foo = obj.foo;
foo.bar = 'baz';
```
                - ...won't trigger reactivity onÂ obj.foo.bar, unless you follow it up withÂ obj = obj.
        - # Props
        - ## Declaring Props
            - So far, we've dealt exclusively with internal state â€” that is to say, the values are only accessible within a given component.
            - In any real application, you'll need to pass data from one component down to its children. To do that, we need to declareÂ __properties__, generally shortened to 'props'. In Svelte, we do that with theÂ exportÂ keyword. Edit theÂ Nested.svelteÂ component:
            - ```javascript
<script>
	export let answer;
</script>```
            - Just likeÂ $:, this may feel a little weird at first. That's not howÂ exportÂ normally works in JavaScript modules! Just roll with it for now â€” it'll soon become second nature.
        - ## Default Values
            - We can easily specify default values for props inÂ Nested.svelte:
            - ```javascript
<script>
	export let answer = 'a mystery';
</script>```
            - If we now add a second componentÂ __without__Â anÂ answerÂ prop, it will fall back to the default:
            - ```javascript
- <Nested answer={42}/><Nested/>
```
        - ## Spread Props
            - If you have an object of properties, you can 'spread' them onto a component instead of specifying each one:
            - ```javascript
<PackageInfo {...pkg}/>```
            - Conversely, if you need to reference all the props that were passed into a component, including ones that weren't declared withÂ export, you can do so by accessingÂ $$propsÂ directly. It's not generally recommended, as it's difficult for Svelte to optimise, but it's useful in rare cases.
        - ## If blocks
            - HTML doesn't have a way of expressingÂ __logic__, like conditionals and loops. Svelte does.
            - To conditionally render some markup, we wrap it in anÂ ifÂ block:
            - ```javascript
- {#if user.loggedIn}
	<button on:click={toggle}>
		Log out
	</button>
  {/if}

{#if !user.loggedIn}
	<button on:click={toggle}>
		Log in
	</button>
 {/if}
```
            - Try it â€” update the component, and click on the buttons.
