- # What is a design system?
    - ![](local-asset://Geaux-Notes/W4iqLOPhAd.png)
    - ## Composed of 5 Pillars
        - ## Design Tokens
            - ### Design Tokens
                - These are the foundation of the brand. The most common design tokens 
are the colors in the brand palette, the fonts or the scale sizes. 
Design Tokens are shared across [Design Kits](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit) and [Component Library](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#component-library) for a cohesive experience.
                - [Learn more about Design Tokens](https://backlight.dev/mastery/design-tokens)
        - ## Design Kit
            - ### Design Kit
                - Also known as UI Kit, a Design Kit is a set of patterns or components existing in [design tools](https://backlight.dev/mastery/best-tools-for-design-kits). Everything follows the design rules and is built using the [Design Tokens](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-tokens).
                - [Learn more about Design Kits](https://backlight.dev/mastery/design-kit)
        - ## Component Library
            - ### Component Library
                - A Component Library is the code side of the [Design Kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit). It's a list of reusable components that developers should use to create new experiences.
                - Like the [Design Kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit), the Component Library uses the [Design Tokens](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-tokens) for a consistent design signature that is easy to maintain.

        - ## Content Design
            - ### Content Design
                - Created by UX Writers, Content Designers or Content Strategists, the 
Content Design is meant to be used by everyone - writers or non-writers.
                - Content
 Design defines voice, tone and glossary, but also rules and 
recommendations for writing in an inclusive and consistent manner.
                - It is like [Design Kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit) for the words and have a tremendous impact on the experience of the user.
                - [Learn more about Content Design](https://backlight.dev/mastery/content-design)
        - ## Documentation Site
            - ### Documentation Site
                - The Documentation site, also called Reference site, is a central 
piece in the Design System definition. It aggregates all previous 
elements like [Design Tokens](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-tokens), [Design Kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit) and [Component library](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#component-library) into a single explorable site. It adds rules and guidelines about when and why a pattern or component should be used or not.
                - Designers will find UI, UX and Content design rules and guidelines alongside references to the Design Kit elements.
                - Developers
 will find development guidelines alongside references to the components
 to use. Most of the time, you will find development "Playgrounds" where
 components can be experienced immediately. This is great for component 
adoption.

- # Why you need a design system [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-need-a-design-system#why-you-need-a-design-system)
    - There are many benefits of a [design system](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system).
    - [Design systems](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system) allow
 you to build a consistent user experience, deploy features more 
quickly, make rebranding changes more efficiently and free-up time to 
address challenging UX issues. At a broad level, we can break-down the 
need for a design system into 5 main categories:
- ## Reduced costs [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-need-a-design-system#reduced-costs)
    - Having everything in one place reduces the amount of work done by multiple 
teams. Reduced design and development time has the potential to save a 
lot of money in the long run.
        - **Shared design library:** For a good design system there should be a single source of truth that 
everyone can refer to, whether it’s the design team, engineering team or
 the product team. Maintaining a single source is quite challenging, but
 helpful in the long run. It's a good idea to look through the design 
library before creating a new component. It enables the system to grow.
        - **Collaborative workflow:** Involve the whole team to create a process that incorporates your design system, while being simple to follow.
- ## More team confidence [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-need-a-design-system#more-team-confidence)
    - Having clear instructions for developing a given user interface gives the team
 more confidence. It is a single source of truth that incorporates [design tokens](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-tokens), a [design kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit) and a [component library](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#component-library). Developers using development guidelines and references to the components helps with brand adoption.
    - Collaboration among all teams is a must-have for creating a customer-centric 
solution. Both teams, designers and developers, must collaborate to 
create well-designed, functional products. When everyone in the team 
contributes to the core design system, it elevates empathy between the 
teams. Only collaborative techniques can bridge the gap between teams 
and make them more efficient and effective.
    - Backlight includes features such as real-time preview and collaboration, 
branch/pull-request management, asynchronous communications and visual 
reviews.
- ## Higher quality [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-need-a-design-system#higher-quality)
    - A design system makes design decisions reusable, allowing product teams 
to build products faster without sacrificing quality. Along with 
technical challenges, quality is a key aspect to tackle. Building 
components in a nested environment, like in a design system, is a good 
way to ensure that components are well crafted and tested 
collaboratively, before being safely shipped to production. It makes the
 customization of components easier to manage and ensures higher quality
 over time.
- ## Greater productivity [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-need-a-design-system#greater-productivity)
    - Productivity improves when everything originates from a single source of truth.
    - A design system greatly removes possible misunderstandings between 
designers and developers, clients and stakeholders. It brings them all 
together.
    - With predefined components and definitions for how they 
are used, when they are used and how they function, unnecessary meetings
 can be forgone, saving teams a lot of time.
    - Backlight includes a number of starter kits to help you get started with your design 
system at a lower cost. The faster you have a design system the faster 
you benefit from it for productivity.
- ## Consistency [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-need-a-design-system#consistency)
    - A product with inconsistent design invariably results in poor user 
experience and inefficient product teams. While new users are confused 
by multiple designs for the same action, new team members don’t have 
components to reuse, leading to a slower onboarding.
    - By building and using a design system, the consistency that comes with it increases 
both the end user experience, ensuring that they are welcomed by the 
same interface elements wherever they are in the product, and the 
product team’s efficiency. Having a set of reusable elements together 
with documentation eliminates the need for the front-end team to make 
design decisions for every single new feature. Instead, they can reapply
 the existing rules that make up the design system.
    - ## Naming
        - Naming design tokens is important. It expresses the semantic of the 
token that can be understood by both developers and designers.
        - There are many ways to create a naming convention. Here are some of the best article on the subject:
    - ## Color Systems for Design Systems
        - Color systems are complete color palettes created with visual consistency and accessibility at their core. [Designing accessible color systems for contrast](https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems) is already challenging but you may be seeking balance (lightness and saturation) too. See [Radix color Balance tests](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/tests/balance).
        - Hereafter are some of the best color systems. Use them, learn from them or get inspired by them.

    - ## [Best tools for Component Libraries](https://backlight.dev/mastery/best-tools-for-component-libraries)
        - # Why you should use open-source component libraries in your Design System [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system)
            - You can write your component library from scratch. But keep in mind that it's an expensive exercise.
            - Instead,
 you can use an open-source component library as core to your design 
system component library and benefit from the most common patterns.
        - ## Use it internally, don't expose it [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#use-it-internally-don-t-expose-it)
            - We recommend not to expose the open-source library through your Design System.
            - Your
 component library should use the 3rd-party component library internally
 and only expose the API you want for your design system.
            - Embedding
 the 3rd-party library lets you replace it internally without impacting 
users of the design system. Additionally, it enables you to use other 
libraries internally with heterogeneous APIs and expose a homogenous API
 from your Design System.
        - ### Example: The Button [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#example-the-button)
            - The most atomic element in a Design System.
            - Many open-source component libraries will come with extensive options to 
style buttons individually. You can change background colors, borders, 
or icons left/right... to name a few.
            - Pseudo code of what it looks like:
            - <Button __bg__="blue" __border__="darkblue" __icon-left__={<Icon __value__="check"/>}>OK</Button><Button __bg__="transparent" __border__="darkblue">Cancel</Button>
            - But that's not what you 
want to expose in your Design System - you want to expose more 
semantical meaning that can encapsulate all the details.
            - <Button __variant__="primary" __icon__="check">OK</Button><Button __variant__="secondary">Cancel</Button>
            - All the details are encapsulated in your Design System, and only the intent of use is exposed.
        - ## What do you get with open-source component libraries? [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#what-do-you-get-with-open-source-component-libraries)
        - ### Accessibility [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#accessibility)
            - Creating accessible control components, as defined in [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/), is one the most challenging aspect of building a component library for the web.
            - Selecting
 an accessible component library is a must. Don't use a component 
library if it's not providing accessibility primitives.
            - See our [curated list of accessible component libraries](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#best-open-source-components-libraries).
        - ### Quality [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#quality)
            - Open-source
 component libraries are used by multiple teams on multiple products. 
You have more production usage, which usually leads to higher overall 
quality.
        - ### It's like having a bigger team [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#it-s-like-having-a-bigger-team)
            - If
 you build your component library from scratch, only the people in your 
organization can answer questions or fix bugs. If you are a massive 
organization like Google or IBM then it's probably not an issue.
            - Using an open-source component library gives you potential access to all teams also using this component library.
        - ## Which one to use? [#](https://backlight.dev/mastery/why-you-should-use-open-source-component-libraries-in-your-design-system#which-one-to-use)
