    - Still no response from Sterling Glenwood on anything - they better be able to take that money and not kick us out.  More from Taskade:
        - I had my interview today and it went ~eh. I could have done much better, but honestly, the guy was pretty challenging. I hope he appreciated how I walked through the interview. I think that might be where I catch a break. If not, I may be in for a long haul looking for work still - gah. One thing I wish is that I would have just focused on how to create a widget - and that's all I shoulda done.
        - Working on my productivity and planning heavily right now. I need to get my personal life squared away before I jump back into trying to get things done. Here are some new ideas I think I may have to try to prevent myself from getting distracted. (I've identified that as a major problem for me - think of that someone with ADHD getting distracted all the time when they're off their meds.) 
        - List of new things to try:
            - ### Zen mode while running Pomodoro Timer
            - ### Create my own Pomodoro Timer to Use
                - This seemed to be highly effective on Lisa's Macbook when I used the Pomodoro Timer I created with Tauri.
            - ### Block all websites and such that aren't related to my project
- ## Night Journaling
    - Sometimes I wish that people would just try to give a shit sometimes. This year has been the shittiest by far and it seems like I'm swimming into an uphill current most of the time. I don't know if this shit will ever change. Maybe it'll end sooner than I think.
    - I don't end like end of life - geesh. But I mean like make it end like give me 5 minutes of relief from stress and frustration of life. Everyday there is just something punching me in the gut as soon as I wake up. It's a brutal existence, especially when your putting so much work into what you do.
