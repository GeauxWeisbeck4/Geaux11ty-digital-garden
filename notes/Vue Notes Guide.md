- Vue demonstrates two main characteristics
    - Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.
    - Reactivity: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.
    - Progressive framework that can be used in many different ways:
        - Enhancing static HTML without a build step
        - Embedding as Web Components on any page
        - Single-Page Application (SPA)
        - Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
        - Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)
        - Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal
