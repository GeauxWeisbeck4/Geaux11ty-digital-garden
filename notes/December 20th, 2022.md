    - I'm feeling good about rent now - I'm pretty sure that we only have to pay November and then we will be fine. Well November + October and then we can catch up on December - don't get my hopes up all too much though, just in case. I would be so relieved if that's the case.
    - Had to reschedule the interview because I wasn't feelin well, so that gives me a little more time to prep and look like a really good developer - well I am a really good developer. I think I just need to boost my confidence and practice some more JavaScript.
    - I really need to get caught up on my content so that is going to be a point of focus today. There are some other things I need to do like clean up these notes, my Logseq notes and then create my digital garden. That is kind of focus number one at the moment, other than learning and practicing. Also applying for jobs and prepping for interview.
        - Let's make today an awesome day and set up a new standard for how my days, weeks, and life are going to go!  - Andrew Sign off 00:05 AM
