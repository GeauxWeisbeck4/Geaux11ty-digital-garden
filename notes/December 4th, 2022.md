    - I'm still up and at it y'all - I'll never quit! Muahahahahaha! I'm so evil hahahahahahaha!
    - Not really, I think I might be going crazy though. Will you still read me if I start going crazy? God I hope so...
    - So while I'm going to really try and get a lot done coding today, both learning and finishing up some projects, I really need to focus on creating content and templates. I also need to create video tutorials, my online course, and my newsletter and podcast today. Those things all make more money than coding does. So that's the goal!
