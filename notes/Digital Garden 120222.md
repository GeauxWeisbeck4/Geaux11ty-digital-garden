- # What is up?
    - About to go wake Lisa up to - you know :)
    - I got some ice and I'm feeling better
    - I need John to go to Henderson really badly
- # I'm probably going to work with Lisa today
    - Yay!
    - I love spending time with her. 
    - Life is too short - I want to spend as much time with Lisa as I can, every day.
    - I need to figure out how to make money and make rent
    - Hopefully this Gerrardo guy is for real and will pay me up front
    - Then we'll be cool for sure
