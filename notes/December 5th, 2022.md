- # Monday morning... starting really early 01:37AM
    - I'm ready to go because I slept from 6AM to 4:30PM. So I'm not tired at all. I've got to get my website done first and then keep working on shit and applying for jobs. 
    - Today is gonna be a good day - I hope to start it off with some sex.
